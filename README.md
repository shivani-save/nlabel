# nlabel

WebApp for creating dataset of labeled images

### What works:
- Generate csv from json of image labels (from dummy data as of now)
- Set list of image labels and generate input fields for every label
- Get list of images by specifying directory path
- Load images from user's directory via symlinks to server's public/data directory
